## Abstract submission and dates
Abstracts of 300 words can submitted to EasyChair, deadline is **4 september 2018**. If you did not meet the deadline but still would like to participate you can contact me (m.w.a.wijntjes@tudelft.nl) asap, maybe there is still something possible while we draft the final programme (no guarantees). Notification of acceptance will be send latest **14 September**.  We will try to accommodate as many contributions as possible yet seats are limited. Presentations will either be oral or poster.
