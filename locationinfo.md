## Venue 
![Atelier gebouw](/images/google3dSmall.png)

The symposium will take place in the ‘Ateliergebouw’ of the Rijksmuseum in Amsterdam, the Netherlands. It is opposite to the main Rijksmuseum building, on 'Hobbemastraat 22'. During the symposium you will have to get your daily access card at the reception, and hand it in at the end of the day. 

On Tuesday and Wednesday we will start at 9.00, which means you have plenty of time to start the day with a swim at the 'Zuiderbad', a very nice swimmingpool just two buildings next to the ‘Ateliergebouw’ (entrance about 4 euro).
