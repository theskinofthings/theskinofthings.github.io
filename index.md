## Introduction
In the art of painting the rendering of space has always been considered of great importance, and perspective, shading and foreshortening have been widely studied. The rendering of materials is quite another matter. It was equally deemed essential for the art painting in the past, but it has received little scholarly or scientific attention until now. This symposium will be devoted both to the art historical aspects of the pictorial evocation of materials, and to the psychology and perception of material properties.

Besides a selection of invited speakers, we welcome proposals for contributions about representing material from both the fields of art history, perceptual studies and computer graphics.



### Scope

In the case of art history we are thinking about topics as painterly techniques, theories of still life, or the development of different styles for depicting materials. In terms of period and region, some emphasis will be on the art of painting in 17th century Europe.

In the field of vision science we are looking forward to contributions concerned with material perception and rendering. We welcome recent findings in texture, material, shape, colour or light perception and rendering that may increase our understanding of how painters depict these. Also research using artefacts (like paintings) to gain novel insights into perception is much appreciated. Furthermore, we would like to organise an extra session concerned with art annotation and/or digital art history, depending on the number of contributions in this area.

If you feel in doubt whether your contribution would fit our scope, please feel free to contact us (e.g. m.w.a.wijntjes@tudelft.nl or J.F.H.J.Stumpel@uu.nl).

## Venue and accommodation
The symposium will take place in the ‘Ateliergebouw’ of the Rijksmuseum in Amsterdam, the Netherlands. Accommodation is not included, but should be relatively easy to arrange since the venue is in the center of Amsterdam.
